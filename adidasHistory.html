  <h2>The History of Addidas</h2>

    <h3>1920s:</h3>
    Adi Dassler, a cobbler from Herzogenaurach, Germany, began making sports shoes in his mother's washroom after World War I. 
    
    <h3>1924: </h3>

    <h3>1940s: </h3>
    World War II disrupted Adidas, and the Dassler brothers worked to rebuild the company. However, a rift between the brothers grew, and in 1948, Rudolf left the company to start his own, which became Puma. Adi rebranded his company as "Adi Dassler Adidas Sportschuhfabrik".
